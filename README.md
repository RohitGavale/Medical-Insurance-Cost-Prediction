## üè• Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

This project is a machine learning-based regression model that predicts medical insurance premiums based on demographic and health-related features such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, gender, and region.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Streamlit (for interactive web app)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

### Dataset
- Sourced from: [Kaggle - Medical Cost Personal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)
- Features included in this Dataset:
  - `age`
  - `sex`
  - `bmi`
  - `children`
  - `smoker`
  - `region`
  - `charges` (target variable)

### Model Overview
- **Problem Type**: Regression
- **Algorithm Used**: Linear Regression/Random Forest Regressor 
- **Goal**: Predict the `charges` column (insurance cost) using other features.
- **Performance Metric**: R¬≤ Score
